## Demo for v10 videojs cli package per [issue #247](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/247)

I've created this as just a proof of concept of how a CLI package could behave. I've only implemented React as I didn't want to spend too much time on a PoC.

### Notes on use of JS
- I've used Javascript for this example as its easy to start with but most likely for production I would assume use of Typescript would be better... however this does add a compile step.
